# AWS Elastic Block Store - Introduction

- EBS provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 & Container instances.
- We can mount these volumes as devices on our EC2 & Container instances. 
- EBS volumes that are attached to an instance are exposed as storage volumes that persist independently from the life of the EC2 or Container instance.
- We can dynamically change the configuration of a volume attached to an instance.
- AWS recommends EBS for data that must be quickly accessible and requires long-term persistence. 
- EBS is well suited to both database-style applications that rely on random reads and writes, and to throughput-intensive applications that perform long, continuous reads and writes.

## AWS EBS CSI Driver
- We are going to use EBS CSI Driver and use EBS Volumes for persistence storage to MySQL Database

## Topics
1. Install EBS CSI Driver
2. Create MySQL Database Deployment & ClusterIP Service
3. Create User Management Microservice Deployment & NodePort Service
