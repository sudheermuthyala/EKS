# Pause the Deployment
kubectl rollout pause deployment/<Deployment-Name>
kubectl rollout pause deployment/my-first-deployment

Observation: No new rollout should start, we should see same number of versions as we check earlier with last version number matches which we have noted earlier.

# Get list of ReplicaSets
kubectl get rs
Observation: No new replicaSet created. We should have same number of replicaSets as earlier when we took note. 

# Make one more change: set limits to our container
kubectl set resources deployment/my-first-deployment -c=kubenginx --limits=cpu=20m,memory=30Mi

```
